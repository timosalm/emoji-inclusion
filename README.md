# Emoji Inclusion

Emoji Inclusion is a simple Spring Boot application that can be used to demonstrate the behavior of an in-memory vs a persistence database with multiple stateless application instances.
It especially works well with ServiceBindings for [Kubernetes](https://servicebinding.io) or [CloudFoundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html).
